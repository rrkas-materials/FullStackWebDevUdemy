ES6 = Ecmascript version 6
JS = ES5
ES is the standard for JS

ES6 properties:
- uses modern syntax
- fixed issues with ES5
- backward compatible with ES5

Disadvantage:
- can run only on modern browsers
Solution:
- we need transpilers such as Bable to convert ES6 to ES5
- always use transpilers in production level apps
